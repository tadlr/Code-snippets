Coding Examples
=======================

Welcome to this repository! I have created it to showcase my coding skills and development approach.

About This Repository
---------------------

I’d be happy to share examples of my work. Unfortunately, due to non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) from previous projects, I am unable to provide the original code. Instead, this repository contains code examples that are representative of the type of work I’ve done, demonstrating my problem-solving abilities, coding style, and adherence to best practices.

The examples provided here are inspired by the kinds of tasks I’ve completed in past roles and are intended to give you an understanding of my technical skills and development process.

What's Inside
-------------

This repository contains various code snippets and small projects, including:

*   **Web Development**: Examples showcasing front-end and back-end development with technologies like **JavaScript, PHP, and Node.js**.
*   **Microservices and APIs**: Demonstrations of building and integrating APIs, including best practices for **RESTful services**.
*   **Database Integration**: Examples of working with **SQL and NoSQL databases**, including data modeling and querying.
*   **DevOps and CI/CD Pipelines**: Sample configurations for **DevOps practices**, including **CI/CD pipelines** using **Docker** and cloud services.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Demonstrations of **unit testing** and **test-driven development** to ensure code quality and reliability.

Tay Fox or Gustavo Ramirez?
---------------------------

You might see both names associated with my work. **Taylor Jay Fox** is the pen name I use for my creative editorial projects, while **Gustavo Ramirez** is my real name. I use the Tay Fox identity for my creative pursuits, such as writing, storytelling, and other artistic endeavours, while I reserve my given name for professional software development and technical projects. Both identities reflect different aspects of my skills and passions.

How to Use This Repository
--------------------------

Why This Matters
----------------

I understand the importance of delivering high-quality, scalable, and secure software solutions. The examples here reflect my commitment to following industry best practices and delivering code that meets project objectives while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.
