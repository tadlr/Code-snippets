Backend - The Furry Project
===========================

This repository contains the backend for **The Furry Project (or whatever is going to be called)**, which powers various features like chat, posts, user management, and more.

Getting Started
---------------

Follow the instructions below to set up the backend on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for local development outside Docker, optional)
*   Prisma CLI (optional for DB migrations)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    `git clone https://github.com/Furry-Project/Backend.git cd Backend`

2.  **Copy the `.env` file**

    Rename the `.example.env` file to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables:

    `cp .example.env .env`

    Update the `.env` file with the necessary credentials and configurations such as database URLs, API keys, etc.

3.  **Install Dependencies**

    If you want to run the project locally without Docker, you need to install the dependencies:


    `yarn install`

    This is optional if you are running the project fully in Docker.


### Running the Project

1.  **Run the Project with Docker**

    To run the full project using Docker:

    `docker compose up --build`

    This will build the project and start all services, including the backend, PostgreSQL, and any additional services.

    To only run the PostgreSQL database, use the following command:

    `docker compose -f docker-compose-db.yml up -d`

    This command will run the database service in detached mode.


2.  **Access API Documentation**

    After the server is running, you can view the API documentation generated by Swagger:

    `http://localhost:3000/docs`

    This will show all the available API endpoints and allow you to test them.

### Database Management

Prisma is used as the ORM for database management. To run migrations or generate Prisma Client:

*   Run the Prisma migration:

    `npx prisma migrate deploy`

*   To open Prisma Studio and explore your database:

    `npx prisma studio`


### Running Migrations (Optional)

If you're running the project locally and need to apply migrations, use:

`npx prisma migrate dev`

This command applies any pending database migrations and updates the Prisma Client.

### Testing

To run the test suite, you can use:

`yarn test`

Ensure the database is running before running tests.

### Linting and Formatting

To lint the project:


`yarn lint`

To format the project using Prettier:

`yarn format`

Technologies Used
-----------------

*   **Node.js**: For building the backend server
*   **Express**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests
*   **PostgreSQL**: The database used for storing data
*   **Prisma**: ORM for managing the database
*   **Swagger**: API documentation
*   **Docker**: For containerizing the project and running services
*   **Joi**: For validating request payloads
*   **bcryptjs**: For password hashing

* * *

Troubleshooting
---------------

1.  **Database connection issues**: Ensure that your database is up and running, and the `.env` file has correct connection details.

2.  **Docker errors**: If you encounter issues with Docker, try running:

    `docker compose down --volumes docker compose up --build`

3.  **Prisma migration issues**: If migrations are out of sync, try running:

    `npx prisma migrate reset`
